# Packages (pkg)

Reusable packages for the CLI application.

## Packages

- **client/** - API clients (REST and gRPC)
- **config/** - Configuration loading and management
- **ui/** - User interface components (TUI, formatters)
- **models/** - Shared data models and types

## Guidelines

- Keep packages focused and single-purpose
- Export only what's necessary
- Document all exported functions and types
- Write comprehensive unit tests
